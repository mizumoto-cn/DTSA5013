 How are the models that we’ve used in this course so far (and in this specialization more broadly) based on the process of induction?

The models we’ve used in this course rely on induction, which involves drawing general rules from specific examples. These models learn patterns from historical data and then generalize these patterns to make predictions about new, unseen data. For instance, a model might be trained on past loan applications to predict the likelihood of default for future applicants. However, the passage highlights that induction requires high-quality data to ensure reliable generalization. If the training data is biased or unrepresentative, the model’s predictions can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes.  The inductive nature of these models also means they are only as good as the data they are trained on, potentially leading to biases or inaccuracies if the data is not representative of the broader population.

“The fact that machine learning is ‘evidence-based” by no means ensures that it will lead to accurate, reliable, or fair decisions.” Provide 2-3 examples of this claim. 

One example is predictive policing, where machine learning models trained on biased crime data can lead to over-policing in minority communities, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and creating a feedback loop of increased policing and arrests. 

Another example is automated hiring systems that may reflect historical biases in employment data, disadvantaging certain demographic groups despite being evidence-based. 

Lastly, a loan approval algorithm might deny loans to individuals from lower-income neighborhoods due to correlations in historical data, even if those correlations are not causally linked to an individual’s creditworthiness, thus perpetuating financial inequalities.

Do you believe that Amazon's same-day delivery system mention on page 3-4 is unfair or unjust? Why or why not?

Amazon's same-day delivery system could be considered unfair because it disproportionately excludes certain neighborhoods, often those with predominantly minority populations. 

Although the system may not explicitly consider race, the impact is racially disparate, providing unequal access to services. This perpetuates existing inequalities and reflects broader issues of geographic segregation and economic disparity in the U.S. The ethical concern is that a system designed for efficiency and cost considerations ends up reinforcing long-standing societal inequities, which could be seen as unjust.  

However, it should also be noted that this might only be the situation in some certain limited countries and/or regions, as I have never come across any similar situations here in Japan while using amazon.co.jp services.

What is the machine learning loop? Do you think that the machine learning loop, given in figure 1, applies to statistical modeling? Justify your answer.

The machine learning loop involves the cycle of data collection, model training, prediction, and feedback. This process is iterative, where predictions made by a model are used to update the model through new data, creating a continuous loop of learning and adjustment.   

This loop , given in figure 1,   can indeed apply to statistical modeling, especially in cases where models are continuously updated or where the impact of decisions made by the model influences future data collection. In statistical modeling, data is often collected from the real world, models are trained on this data, and predictions or decisions are made. The results of these decisions can influence future states of the world, leading to new data collection and further model refinement. For instance, in predictive maintenance, a model predicting equipment failure may lead to preemptive maintenance actions, which in turn affects future failure rates and data. Thus, statistical modeling shares the iterative nature of learning and action-feedback loops with machine learning, although the extent of automation and feedback integration might vary.
